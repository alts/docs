Getting started with Rime's TTS API is super simple. All you have to do is:

1. Generate an [API key](https://rime.ai/dashboard/tokens).
2. Pick a speaker code for the voice you want. For this example let's pick: `rose`
3. Make an API call with the tool of your choosing. Let's use python's _requests_ library here:

```python
import requests

url = 'https://users.rime.ai/v1/rime-tts'

headers = {
    'Authorization': 'Bearer YOUR_RIME_KEY',
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'}

data = {
    'text': 'I would love to have a conversation with you.',
    'speaker': 'rose',
    'audioFormat': 'mp3', # Optional - default value is 'wav', permitted values: 'ogg', 'mp3', 'wav'
    'samplingRate': 8000, # Optional - processes resampling server-side
    'speedAlpha': 1.3,     # Optional - controls speed üéöÔ∏è 1.0 = default, higher is slower
    }

response = requests.post(url, headers=headers, json=data)
```

Here's a curl example for `rime-tts`:

```bash
curl -X POST http://users.rime.ai/v1/rime-tts \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_RIME_KEY' \
  -d '{"text": "Yes, that is true. But that'\''s okay with me. And you better never forget it.", "speaker": "young_female_latina-4"}'
```

If the request is successful, the response body contains data with the following structure:

```json
{
  "audioContent": string
}
```

This field contains the audio data bytes encoded in base-64 representing audio with WAV header.

We can decode the base-64 encoded string using the python _base64_ library.

```python
import base64

with open('output.wav', 'wb') as fp:
    fp.write(base64.b64decode(response.json()['audioContent']))

```
