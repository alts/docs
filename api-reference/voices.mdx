Rime's TTS functionality exposes both a large set of demographically diverse set of voices to users as well as an increasingly large toolkit for generating voices on the fly.

## Demographic categories

Rime currently has many voices across a number of demographic categories (including Southern, African American, Latina, Midwestern, and LGBT voices) as well as age ranges from young to old.
